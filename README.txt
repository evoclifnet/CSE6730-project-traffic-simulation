Checkpoint
A jupyter notebook named "cse6730_project_traffic_checkpoint.ipynb" in the <checkpoint> folder 
includes the model script and checkpoint report. All the relevant data (.csv) and figures (.png)
in the markdown cells are in the same folder.
A colab link for this jupyter notebook is attached for reference:

The checkpoint report is converted from the jupyter notebook and is named as "cse6730_project_
